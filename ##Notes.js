JS Notes

??? "let, var, const"~
/*
let and const have scope of block level, whereas var has scope of global level. it is advisable not to use var , because it can cause a large amount of bugs , so it is not preferrable to use it in code . const variables have a set value which cannot be changed once it is declared ,whereas  the value of let can be changed.
*/

??? "OBJECTS" ~
/*
Objects are key value pairs in js , and we can acces the data inside the object using the dot operator.
